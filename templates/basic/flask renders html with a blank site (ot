flask renders html with a blank site (other then css and the main div.)

javascript makes POST request to flask server on /messages and the server checks if session['logged_in'] is true. If it is, the server goes to the messages database
and retreives the data that's associated with that specific user. The database will include all past messages and will be encrypted. Flask will decrypt the info 
with [placeholder] and will send it back to javascript.

1. js sends post to find all the recent users that is stored in 





database will contain messages, time and author. A database will be created for each conversation between people. every message that will be sent will be stored in
the appropriate database. The database will be on a (local for now) remote server.
